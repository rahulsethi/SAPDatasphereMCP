# SAP Datasphere MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes SAP Datasphere as a set of tools and resources for AI agents.

- **Goal:** Provide safe, read-only access (initially) to SAP Datasphere spaces, assets, metadata, and data via a standard MCP interface.
- **Usage:** Can be plugged into any MCP-compatible agent (Claude, custom tools, etc.) and will later be integrated with **DevAssist/Sethi** as its Datasphere connector.

Work in progress – Phase A (project scaffolding & basic health tool).
